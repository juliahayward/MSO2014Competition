==================

Code from the Mind Sports Olympiad XVIII Programming event, August 2014. 

This is pretty much the code I wrote during the event, which is a 2.5 hour blitz to solve a number of coding
problems. This code won me the silver medal; there were a couple of bugs which cost me gold, most notably the 
backtracking in the Sudoku; both meant that the test cases we'd been given passed but the one used by the judge 
failed. These bugs have been fixed and a few comments have been added.

THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE - please do not assume I write like this in my day job! 
The aim is to get through the problems as fast as you can, as it's barely possible to complete the lot in the
time available. It obviously wouldn't be much of a test if it was easy to produce elegant bug-free code!

There's no restriction on the language used - other contestants have used Python, Java, PHP and C++ - but
no internet access.
